       Class::Accessor is a great way to automate the tedious task of generat-
       ing accessors and mutators. One small drawback is that due to the
       details of the implemenetation, you only get one "__ANON__" entry in
       profiling output.  That entry contains all your accessors, which can be
       a real pain if you're attempting to figure out _w_h_i_c_h of your accessors
       is being called six billion times.  This module is a development aid
       which uses Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name to talk your accessors into
       identifying themselves. While it shouldn't add much additional runtime
       overhead (as it acts only Class::Accessor's generator functions), it
       has not been designed for production deployment,
